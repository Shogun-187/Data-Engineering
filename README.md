# Data Engineering

Welcome fellow programmer! 

The purpose of this repository is to build a collection of scripts that might be useful when working with data. If you work with data, you'll find yourself doing things like collecting new data, augmenting data, cleaning data, transforming data, storing data, etc. These are some of the scripts that I have built to help me tackle those tasks and since I am lazy and I don't want to write the same code every single time I get a new task, I will just save them here and share them with anybody who might need them.
